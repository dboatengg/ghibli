# INRODUCTION TO WEB APIS

## API OVERVIEW

- JavaScript can exist as a client and server-side programming language.

- Client-side programming language means that source code is processed by a user's or client's browser whiles Server-side programming language means that runs on a server from a database.

- APIs that are available in client-side JavaScript are not part of the JavaScript language but rather they are built on top of the JavaScript language and helps provide some superpowers in using the JavaScript language.

- API stands for Application Programming Interface

- Construct: An element that is formed or buildt by combining different parts/components together

- API refers to constructs that are available in programming languages and helps to create or implement very complex functionalities in an easy way. It works by hiding complex code and replacing them with a more easy syntax.

- An API transfers data between a server and user's machine.

- A server can be a software or hardware that provides various services to other softwares or hardwares.

- Example of a server and an API: As soon as a weather app on your phone is conntecd to an internet, a data is requested by your mobile phone and sent to a server, and finally an API fetches the requested data from the server to your mobile to display the current weather on the app.

## CATEGORIES OF CLIENT-SIDE APIs

- JavaScript client-side APIs can be grouped in two categories:

1. Browser APIs: These APIs are complex low-level code (constructs) which are already built into browsers to help perform usefil functionalities (actions) in an easier way (easy-to-understand syntax). For example, the Web Audio API provides constructs for manipulating audio in the browser.

2. Third party APIs: These are constructs built into other platforms such as Twitter, facebook, netflix,etc. that allows developers to use some functionalities from these platforms in our web page. For displaying youtube videos or recent Instagram post on our webpage.

## USES OF APIs

- It is used for manipulating documents e.g.s. DOM API
- Fetching data from a server e.g.s. XMLHttpRequest, Fetch API
- Storing data on the client side e.g.s. Web Storage API, IndexedDM API.
- For manipulating videos and audios. e.g.s HTMLMediaElement, Web Audio API & WebRTC.
  > The examples given above are all browser APIs.
